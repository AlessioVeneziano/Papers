The climate data is too big and could not be uploaded on GitHub.
The climate data consists of three .tif images (one for each climate variable used in the analysis).
The three variables are BIO4, BIO7 and BIO15 of the WorldClim database and can be downloaded at www.worldclim.org, with resolution at 2.5 minutes.
In R, they can be obtained through the function 'worldclim_global' in the package 'geodata'.
