This folder contains the script to reproduce the paper _Relation Between Nasal Septum Deviation and Facial Asymmetry: An Ontogenetic Analysis From Infants to Children Using Geometric Morphometrics_. Some dummy data is also provided to test the script.

ATTENTION! ATTENTION! ATTENTION!
The data provided is only a small subsample of the original dataset, therefore the results obtained in the script are not the same ones presented in the paper. The script and data are provided to guide through the analysis and provide a reproducible example.
